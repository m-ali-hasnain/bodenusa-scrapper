My other comment is that the elastic in the high waist band is twisted. But I am going to fix this. A fabulous dress!",

I have multiple patterns and always receive compliments when I wear them. Easy to throw on and go while still looking put together.",

I am 5'10 so this becomes more of a long midi than a maxi, but looks really nice with flip flops or slightly dressier with espadrilles for summer."

            "I had to act quickly on this one. I could see the shrimp dress was selling fast. While it cost a lot more than I'd have liked to pay for a casual dress, once it arrived any concerns I had disappeared. I ordered the 12L and I'm 175cms tall and it hits right at the bottom of my knee. No tightness or gaping across the bust and it kindly glides over my ample bottom and thighs. I wear slips underneath my unlined dresses to give a smoother outline and will do the same with this dress. The only issue I can see is that it will require ironing every wear and this might wear thin after a while, especially if I'm on holiday. Apart from this, it's a well designed dress and I'm glad I dared to buy something a little different.",
            "Unlike a lot of the other reviews I was happy with my usual size for a comfy, relaxed fit. The print really is super fun and looks just as good in real life as it does in the model shots. As always, thank you for pockets!!!"

I have spent months trying to find a dress for a destination wedding and as a short, round woman I was wading through the endless puff sleeved tiered maxi Little House on the Prairie dresses that seem to be all that other stores are selling this season. This fits beautifully, feels great and the neckline draws the attention upwards plus I don't need to worry about jewellery.",

I bought size 14 US in black and was surprised it fit well except for the bodice that gaped on the sides. Also the front bands rode up to my neck as if the back of the dress was too heavy for them. I considered buying a smaller size to have the sides/underarms fit. But the neckline bands riding towards my neck were a dealbreaker. So sad as the print and length are lovely."

            "Beautiful dress, loved the colour. But I wanted a maxi dress, not a midi. I am 5ft10 and ordered the regular as there was no tall version of the dress. This has previously worked fine with other Boden maxi dresses. However, this dress ends at mid calf on me, so I have had to send it back. A real shame, as had it been a few inches longer, it would have been perfect.",
            "I'm 5ft 1 and I bought the petite length. I feel the photography is slightly misleading as it implies the dress comes up quite high, with enough coverage up top to make it suitable for work. But in fact, the straps are about two inches too long for me, thereby creating a very low neckline. Admittedly this gives me a fabulous cleavage, but it's definitely not office-appropriate, especially for those of us with larger cup sizes. I was debating whether to shorten the straps or not, but I think I'm going to leave them as they are and keep the dress for going to the park on hot days. It's a really good quality fabric with a good weight, not flimsy, with plenty of stretch so it still fits even if you're a larger size on your bottom half."

With the volume of fabric and the placement of the cutouts, it is too obvious that the waistband is out of place and I will have to return. As per a previous review, I found the cutouts appear larger on me than the model in the picture. I'm between a 10 and a 12 and found the smaller size a better fit in this style."

The ruching is below my (smallish) bust, but I could imagine this dress not fitting as well on someone with a large bust. The material is so soft and comfortable, and doesn't wrinkle (it traveled well through 6 plane flights!). It's dressy enough for somewhat dressy occasions, but not too fancy for casual occasions. I wore it with Tevas for casual occasions, but it would look great with espadrilles (which I don't own). I LOVE that it has pockets. LOVE. And unlike in some dresses, the pockets don't create a lumpy look.",

This dress finally fits our bill for a cute, appropriate cut dress for a pre-teen, perfect for school pictures, church, or the occasional family dinner out! I plan to grab this dress in a few more colors. I purchased her a 2R in the coastal design print for reference and it hits right above knee. And she is crazy about the pockets!"

I'm normally a 10 in dresses and skirts but saw this was coming up a bit big for other reviewers so I sized down to an 8 PET. When it arrived the size was bang on, but the fit didn't suit me at all. The elasticated waist meant the dress fell really strangely on my curvy frame and wasn't flattering at all. Also uncomfortable as the waist felt scratchy. Sadly had to return it. Please do more dresses in this style Boden but with wider waist bands that fall nicely?",

            "I got this dress in the green print (which is no longer available -- too bad, it's beautiful). I'm 5'2\", got the petite, and the dress hits just above my knees. The ruching is below my (smallish) bust, but I could imagine this dress not fitting as well on someone with a large bust. The material is so soft and comfortable, and doesn't wrinkle (it traveled well through 6 plane flights!). It's dressy enough for somewhat dressy occasions, but not too fancy for casual occasions. I wore it with Tevas for casual occasions, but it would look great with espadrilles (which I don't own). I LOVE that it has pockets. LOVE. And unlike in some dresses, the pockets don't create a lumpy look.",
            "So here's the thing, my soon to be 12 year daughter is already 5'6\" tall and 115 lbs and is in that odd space where she can't wear mini boden anymore (so sad), but ladies' clothes are either too low cut or just too old looking for her. This dress finally fits our bill for a cute, appropriate cut dress for a pre-teen, perfect for school pictures, church, or the occasional family dinner out! I plan to grab this dress in a few more colors. I purchased her a 2R in the coastal design print for reference and it hits right above knee. And she is crazy about the pockets!"

            "I had to act quickly on this one. I could see the shrimp dress was selling fast. While it cost a lot more than I'd have liked to pay for a casual dress, once it arrived any concerns I had disappeared. I ordered the 12L and I'm 175cms tall and it hits right at the bottom of my knee. No tightness or gaping across the bust and it kindly glides over my ample bottom and thighs. I wear slips underneath my unlined dresses to give a smoother outline and will do the same with this dress. The only issue I can see is that it will require ironing every wear and this might wear thin after a while, especially if I'm on holiday. Apart from this, it's a well designed dress and I'm glad I dared to buy something a little different.",
            "Unlike a lot of the other reviews I was happy with my usual size for a comfy, relaxed fit. The print really is super fun and looks just as good in real life as it does in the model shots. As always, thank you for pockets!!!"

I have spent months trying to find a dress for a destination wedding and as a short, round woman I was wading through the endless puff sleeved tiered maxi Little House on the Prairie dresses that seem to be all that other stores are selling this season. This fits beautifully, feels great and the neckline draws the attention upwards plus I don't need to worry about jewellery.",

I bought size 14 US in black and was surprised it fit well except for the bodice that gaped on the sides. Also the front bands rode up to my neck as if the back of the dress was too heavy for them. I considered buying a smaller size to have the sides/underarms fit. But the neckline bands riding towards my neck were a dealbreaker. So sad as the print and length are lovely."

            "I got this dress in the green print (which is no longer available -- too bad, it's beautiful). I'm 5'2\", got the petite, and the dress hits just above my knees. The ruching is below my (smallish) bust, but I could imagine this dress not fitting as well on someone with a large bust. The material is so soft and comfortable, and doesn't wrinkle (it traveled well through 6 plane flights!). It's dressy enough for somewhat dressy occasions, but not too fancy for casual occasions. I wore it with Tevas for casual occasions, but it would look great with espadrilles (which I don't own). I LOVE that it has pockets. LOVE. And unlike in some dresses, the pockets don't create a lumpy look.",
            "So here's the thing, my soon to be 12 year daughter is already 5'6\" tall and 115 lbs and is in that odd space where she can't wear mini boden anymore (so sad), but ladies' clothes are either too low cut or just too old looking for her. This dress finally fits our bill for a cute, appropriate cut dress for a pre-teen, perfect for school pictures, church, or the occasional family dinner out! I plan to grab this dress in a few more colors. I purchased her a 2R in the coastal design print for reference and it hits right above knee. And she is crazy about the pockets!"

            "As other reviewers have stated, the back buttons come unfastened with any movement. It's not too tight in the chest either so it has to be the button design. Also, tall sizes are delayed until September, which didn't help me since I needed a dress for a wedding in August. I could almost pass on the length with flats, but the buttons are a shame so I had to return. I'm 36C and ordered 8R and it felt tts. The green color is perfect.",
            "I initially ordered this in my usual size 10, and it was deeply unflattering as it swamped me (I'm only 5ft and would usually go for petite). Reordered in size 8 and it's perfect - I'm delighted! Beautiful high quality material, fully lined, and I love the back detail. Yes the buttons pop undone, but the neckline is large enough to slip it on and off without touching the buttons, so I'm planning on stitching the back closed which will mean this doesn't matter. Now I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the white version comes back in stock in size 8..."

            "I have been ordering several dresses for an upcoming wedding and this 1 is my favorite so far. I got it in blue and I do like the color. The ruching detail is very nice. I initially ordered a 16 based on the measurements but ended up having to go with a 14... might even be able to do a 12. I got it on sale but I don't think I would pay 180 for it... The fabric is nice and light which can be a pro for summer but it just doesn't feel worth 180. Also, if I keep it I will have to get it hemmed for it to actually be a midi dress which is a little surprising because I am 5'7\"."

The ruching is below my (smallish) bust, but I could imagine this dress not fitting as well on someone with a large bust. The material is so soft and comfortable, and doesn't wrinkle (it traveled well through 6 plane flights!). It's dressy enough for somewhat dressy occasions, but not too fancy for casual occasions. I wore it with Tevas for casual occasions, but it would look great with espadrilles (which I don't own). I LOVE that it has pockets. LOVE. And unlike in some dresses, the pockets don't create a lumpy look.",
            "So here's the thing, my soon to be 12 year daughter is already 5'6\" tall and 115 lbs and is in that odd space where she can't wear mini boden anymore (so sad), but ladies' clothes are either too low cut or just too old looking for her. This dress finally fits our bill for a cute, appropriate cut dress for a pre-teen, perfect for school pictures, church, or the occasional family dinner out! I plan to grab this dress in a few more colors. I purchased her a 2R in the coastal design print for reference and it hits right above knee. And she is crazy about the pockets!"

I had looked forward to wearing it with wedges/ sandals and had purchased it to take away on holiday. It is still RIDICULOUSLY ENORMOUS. Really bulky and absolutely huge around the waist. So unflattering and really disappointing. I just don't understand it, it is unbelievably huge and yet the dress is so lovely otherwise and would/ should have been a huge seller. Beyond disappointed . Overpriced and underwhelmed recently with pricing and sizing . What is going on Boden??",

There are plenty of these in the high street, but at my age I don't want sections (backless, sideless etc)of the top half of the dress showing my flesh. This one is spot on. I sized down after reading reviews, and it is a perfect fit. I'm 5'2\" fairly slim and usually buy a size 10, so I ordered size 8 petite. It's a lovely fit and looks elegant."

The ruching is below my (smallish) bust, but I could imagine this dress not fitting as well on someone with a large bust. The material is so soft and comfortable, and doesn't wrinkle (it traveled well through 6 plane flights!). It's dressy enough for somewhat dressy occasions, but not too fancy for casual occasions. I wore it with Tevas for casual occasions, but it would look great with espadrilles (which I don't own). I LOVE that it has pockets. LOVE. And unlike in some dresses, the pockets don't create a lumpy look.",
            "So here's the thing, my soon to be 12 year daughter is already 5'6\" tall and 115 lbs and is in that odd space where she can't wear mini boden anymore (so sad), but ladies' clothes are either too low cut or just too old looking for her. This dress finally fits our bill for a cute, appropriate cut dress for a pre-teen, perfect for school pictures, church, or the occasional family dinner out! I plan to grab this dress in a few more colors. I purchased her a 2R in the coastal design print for reference and it hits right above knee. And she is crazy about the pockets!"

            "I got this dress in the green print (which is no longer available -- too bad, it's beautiful). I'm 5'2\", got the petite, and the dress hits just above my knees. The ruching is below my (smallish) bust, but I could imagine this dress not fitting as well on someone with a large bust. The material is so soft and comfortable, and doesn't wrinkle (it traveled well through 6 plane flights!). It's dressy enough for somewhat dressy occasions, but not too fancy for casual occasions. I wore it with Tevas for casual occasions, but it would look great with espadrilles (which I don't own). I LOVE that it has pockets. LOVE. And unlike in some dresses, the pockets don't create a lumpy look.",
            "So here's the thing, my soon to be 12 year daughter is already 5'6\" tall and 115 lbs and is in that odd space where she can't wear mini boden anymore (so sad), but ladies' clothes are either too low cut or just too old looking for her. This dress finally fits our bill for a cute, appropriate cut dress for a pre-teen, perfect for school pictures, church, or the occasional family dinner out! I plan to grab this dress in a few more colors. I purchased her a 2R in the coastal design print for reference and it hits right above knee. And she is crazy about the pockets!"

So unflattering and really disappointing. I just don't understand it, it is unbelievably huge and yet the dress is so lovely otherwise and would/ should have been a huge seller. Beyond disappointed . Overpriced and underwhelmed recently with pricing and sizing . What is going on Boden??",

There are plenty of these in the high street, but at my age I don't want sections (backless, sideless etc)of the top half of the dress showing my flesh. This one is spot on. I sized down after reading reviews, and it is a perfect fit. I'm 5'2\" fairly slim and usually buy a size 10, so I ordered size 8 petite. It's a lovely fit and looks elegant."

The fabric is nice and light which can be a pro for summer but it just doesn't feel worth 180. Also, if I keep it I will have to get it hemmed for it to actually be a midi dress which is a little surprising because I am 5'7\"."

The ruching is below my (smallish) bust, but I could imagine this dress not fitting as well on someone with a large bust. The material is so soft and comfortable, and doesn't wrinkle (it traveled well through 6 plane flights!). It's dressy enough for somewhat dressy occasions, but not too fancy for casual occasions. I wore it with Tevas for casual occasions, but it would look great with espadrilles (which I don't own). I LOVE that it has pockets. LOVE. And unlike in some dresses, the pockets don't create a lumpy look.",
            "So here's the thing, my soon to be 12 year daughter is already 5'6\" tall and 115 lbs and is in that odd space where she can't wear mini boden anymore (so sad), but ladies' clothes are either too low cut or just too old looking for her. This dress finally fits our bill for a cute, appropriate cut dress for a pre-teen, perfect for school pictures, church, or the occasional family dinner out! I plan to grab this dress in a few more colors. I purchased her a 2R in the coastal design print for reference and it hits right above knee. And she is crazy about the pockets!"

            "I've been looking for a boho style white long-sleeved midi dress for ages and it looked like this number was it - the square neck, flared sleeves and embroidery grabbed my attention. I'm normally a 10 in dresses and skirts but saw this was coming up a bit big for other reviewers so I sized down to an 8 PET. When it arrived the size was bang on, but the fit didn't suit me at all. The elasticated waist meant the dress fell really strangely on my curvy frame and wasn't flattering at all. Also uncomfortable as the waist felt scratchy. Sadly had to return it. Please do more dresses in this style Boden but with wider waist bands that fall nicely?",

Also, tall sizes are delayed until September, which didn't help me since I needed a dress for a wedding in August. I could almost pass on the length with flats, but the buttons are a shame so I had to return. I'm 36C and ordered 8R and it felt tts. The green color is perfect.",
            "I initially ordered this in my usual size 10, and it was deeply unflattering as it swamped me (I'm only 5ft and would usually go for petite). Reordered in size 8 and it's perfect - I'm delighted! Beautiful high quality material, fully lined, and I love the back detail. Yes the buttons pop undone, but the neckline is large enough to slip it on and off without touching the buttons, so I'm planning on stitching the back closed which will mean this doesn't matter. Now I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the white version comes back in stock in size 8..."

            "Disappointed in this dress. I love the color and embroidery but Boden cut corners by not putting a zipper in the back or under the arm. As a consequence, the waist has to be big enough to pull on over your head and shoulders. It is a woven fabric, does not stretch. The dress in my usual size 10 fits great in the shoulders and bust but is much, much too big around the waist, just way too much material hanging there like a tent. I could wear it as a caftan but not as a dress. I'd like to see this made a bit more fitted at the waist but that would require a zipper to get it on and off."

The zipper quality (I remember when zippers were actually good with steel teeth and didn't ever get stuck)\u2026 however the zipper is the worst I've seen in a while- tiny plastic teeth that will surely bend in a few wears. It arrived already sticking at the seam before wearing. My very slim college aged daughter could not zip up without a struggle. Unfortunately this must be returned. A nice jumpsuit ruined by a dollar store quality zipper."

            "This is really the first time I have bought a dress and was horrified when it arrived. The colours looked nothing like the colours online more brown and the pink was very pronounced . Had to go straight back"

Too big in the chest and \"poofs\" unnaturally once tied at the waist. I'm keeping it, but only for super casual events or running errands. . Would not recommend for anything more formal due to un flattering fit.",
            "I just received this dress. I had to order it a size smaller than I normally wear but it fit fine. It runs a little big. Really nice quality embroidery. I did not realize it was lined but this makes it substantial enough to wear to work. I also had to get tall, but this is fine as it hits just below the knee, again, good for work. I got lots of compliments when I wore it today."

The red spaghetti strap was already a bit looser on her than the yellow side, but I thought it would be fine. Sadly it DID NOT hold up to a 3 year old style of dressing (she pulls it on by the straps like all young kids). The red strap is now INCHES longer than the other side and she doesn't want to wear it because it is uncomfortable and falls down. It's cute, but just not durable."

Thankfully, they've gotten rid of the stiff button at the back of the neck as well; this has long been the least favorite detail of far too many boden designs. While the photo online shows the tiny, stiff neck button, the dress that arrived simply fit over the head, no buttoning required. Absolutely love this dress!"

            "I had to act quickly on this one. I could see the shrimp dress was selling fast. While it cost a lot more than I'd have liked to pay for a casual dress, once it arrived any concerns I had disappeared. I ordered the 12L and I'm 175cms tall and it hits right at the bottom of my knee. No tightness or gaping across the bust and it kindly glides over my ample bottom and thighs. I wear slips underneath my unlined dresses to give a smoother outline and will do the same with this dress. The only issue I can see is that it will require ironing every wear and this might wear thin after a while, especially if I'm on holiday. Apart from this, it's a well designed dress and I'm glad I dared to buy something a little different.",
            "Unlike a lot of the other reviews I was happy with my usual size for a comfy, relaxed fit. The print really is super fun and looks just as good in real life as it does in the model shots. As always, thank you for pockets!!!"

The zipper quality (I remember when zippers were actually good with steel teeth and didn't ever get stuck)\u2026 however the zipper is the worst I've seen in a while- tiny plastic teeth that will surely bend in a few wears. It arrived already sticking at the seam before wearing. My very slim college aged daughter could not zip up without a struggle. Unfortunately this must be returned.

            "I bought the ruched halter swimsuit from Boden in 2018 and loved it! It was less of a wrap style and just a halter with gathered fabric at the belly. I've gained a bit of weight since then and the comments recommended to size up so I went from a 6 to a 12. Unfortunately I think it's a bit too big and the wrap style is less flattering- it feels like there are too many layers of fabric on the belly and I'm always tugging at it to get it to sit right. There is also not much support and no ruching in the lower belly where I need it with my mummy tummy. So if your hoping for the ruched style to distract from your belly I'm afraid this is not it.",

            "I bought the ruched halter swimsuit from Boden in 2018 and loved it! It was less of a wrap style and just a halter with gathered fabric at the belly. I've gained a bit of weight since then and the comments recommended to size up so I went from a 6 to a 12. Unfortunately I think it's a bit too big and the wrap style is less flattering- it feels like there are too many layers of fabric on the belly and I'm always tugging at it to get it to sit right. There is also not much support and no ruching in the lower belly where I need it with my mummy tummy. So if your hoping for the ruched style to distract from your belly I'm afraid this is not it.",

            "I love the color combo and the vintage feel of the suit. The straps are removable which I did not realize. I might end up criss crossing the straps in the back if it doesn't stay up with in the water. This suit has a control like netting inside making it a little hard to put on but looks great once on (I have one from a previous season that is the same). Also has about 3 in of boning on the sides giving it a bra like feel. If you have tactile issue, you may not like this suit (the netting and boning make it a little rough feeling). This one does have silicone like trim on the tops of the cups on the inside, I assume due to the removable straps to keep it up when taken off, which makes this suit a little less comfortable. Probably will not be a suit I will wear for the sole purpose of swimming but it will look great poolside when hanging out with friends."

The fabric is a heavy weight and the standard of quality is evident from the moment of taking them out of the packet. I'm 5ft3 and a size 14 so ordered the 14P and they are perfect. So flattering and they hold their shape. Not too skinny, kind of a hybrid between a skinny and a mom. I just love them and got them in the sale, otherwise I'd never have tried them.

As a consequence, the waist has to be big enough to pull on over your head and shoulders. It is a woven fabric, does not stretch. The dress in my usual size 10 fits great in the shoulders and bust but is much, much too big around the waist, just way too much material hanging there like a tent. I could wear it as a caftan but not as a dress. I'd like to see this made a bit more fitted at the waist but that would require a zipper to get it on and off."

The armhole / sleeve is also a perfect cut, not too high or low with nothing 'hanging out' unlike some of the sleeveless offerings. Its super comfy and I've worn it casually and dressed up and get many compliments. I'm sure I will continue to wear it in the winter too with tights and a jacket or cardi on top. Please can we have more colours Boden??"

I had looked forward to wearing it with wedges/ sandals and had purchased it to take away on holiday. It is still RIDICULOUSLY ENORMOUS. Really bulky and absolutely huge around the waist. So unflattering and really disappointing. I just don't understand it, it is unbelievably huge and yet the dress is so lovely otherwise and would/ should have been a huge seller. Beyond disappointed . Overpriced and underwhelmed recently with pricing and sizing . What is going on Boden??",
            "I'm a mature lady and was looking for a long white maxi dress to wear on my holiday. There are plenty of these in the high street, but at my age I don't want sections (backless, sideless etc)of the top half of the dress showing my flesh. This one is spot on. I sized down after reading reviews, and it is a perfect fit. I'm 5'2\" fairly slim and usually buy a size 10, so I ordered size 8 petite. It's a lovely fit and looks elegant."

            "Gorgeous dress and so excited to receive it- I had read the reviews and ordered 2 sizes smaller ( size 6) . I had looked forward to wearing it with wedges/ sandals and had purchased it to take away on holiday. It is still RIDICULOUSLY ENORMOUS. Really bulky and absolutely huge around the waist. So unflattering and really disappointing. I just don't understand it, it is unbelievably huge and yet the dress is so lovely otherwise and would/ should have been a huge seller. Beyond disappointed . Overpriced and underwhelmed recently with pricing and sizing . What is going on Boden??",
            "I'm a mature lady and was looking for a long white maxi dress to wear on my holiday. There are plenty of these in the high street, but at my age I don't want sections (backless, sideless etc)of the top half of the dress showing my flesh. This one is spot on. I sized down after reading reviews, and it is a perfect fit. I'm 5'2\" fairly slim and usually buy a size 10, so I ordered size 8 petite. It's a lovely fit and looks elegant."

            "Beautiful dress, loved the colour. But I wanted a maxi dress, not a midi. I am 5ft10 and ordered the regular as there was no tall version of the dress. This has previously worked fine with other Boden maxi dresses. However, this dress ends at mid calf on me, so I have had to send it back. A real shame, as had it been a few inches longer, it would have been perfect.",
            "I'm 5ft 1 and I bought the petite length. I feel the photography is slightly misleading as it implies the dress comes up quite high, with enough coverage up top to make it suitable for work. But in fact, the straps are about two inches too long for me, thereby creating a very low neckline. Admittedly this gives me a fabulous cleavage, but it's definitely not office-appropriate, especially for those of us with larger cup sizes. I was debating whether to shorten the straps or not, but I think I'm going to leave them as they are and keep the dress for going to the park on hot days. It's a really good quality fabric with a good weight, not flimsy, with plenty of stretch so it still fits even if you're a larger size on your bottom half."

            "I had to act quickly on this one. I could see the shrimp dress was selling fast. While it cost a lot more than I'd have liked to pay for a casual dress, once it arrived any concerns I had disappeared. I ordered the 12L and I'm 175cms tall and it hits right at the bottom of my knee. No tightness or gaping across the bust and it kindly glides over my ample bottom and thighs. I wear slips underneath my unlined dresses to give a smoother outline and will do the same with this dress. The only issue I can see is that it will require ironing every wear and this might wear thin after a while, especially if I'm on holiday. Apart from this, it's a well designed dress and I'm glad I dared to buy something a little different.",
            "Unlike a lot of the other reviews I was happy with my usual size for a comfy, relaxed fit. The print really is super fun and looks just as good in real life as it does in the model shots. As always, thank you for pockets!!!"

The fabric is a heavy weight and the standard of quality is evident from the moment of taking them out of the packet. I'm 5ft3 and a size 14 so ordered the 14P and they are perfect. So flattering and they hold their shape. Not too skinny, kind of a hybrid between a skinny and a mom. I just love them and got them in the sale, otherwise I'd never have tried them.

I persevered and even got one which was subsequently cancelled as the account credit I thought I had I didn't and in getting it sorted it went back out of stock. FINALLY it appeared and I snapped it up. The fit is great as I did worry that it might just be too short and also too wide across the body as the style looks a bit 'puffy'. Bearing in mind that I am 60 years young it was a bit of a risk but I've no wrinkles to be concerned about on my torso so feel I can get away with it as it's not too cropped on me.

This time I bought the new ombre striped version -- wow the colors are bright. But I have the same fit issues I've always had: fits in shoulders and bust , loose almost baggy arms (??) boxy thru waist, then somehow more fitted/snug than expected over my hips. I have a straight build. It just looks funny on me. So alas, I'll return this one too and eventually give up trying to find a fit I can wear."

I persevered and even got one which was subsequently cancelled as the account credit I thought I had I didn't and in getting it sorted it went back out of stock. FINALLY it appeared and I snapped it up. The fit is great as I did worry that it might just be too short and also too wide across the body as the style looks a bit 'puffy'. Bearing in mind that I am 60 years young it was a bit of a risk but I've no wrinkles to be concerned about on my torso so feel I can get away with it as it's not too cropped on me.

            "As my daughters graduation ceremony approached and the temperature was forecast to be 34c I had to quickly reevaluate my outfit which was perfect for a typical unpredictable English summer day but not a long day in this heat. I spotted this top and matching skirt and bought in desperation that it would fit the bill. The cotton top is fitted but not clingy and in a beautiful soft lined fabric. The skirt meets the top perfectly ((I was concerned that my midriff may be on show but it isn't). The skirt flares flatteringly and ends at my low calf and together they actually look like a dress. I don't buy items which I can't wear in a number of ways and these 2 will give me lots of options. For reference, I am a flat chested, athletic size 10 and 5'6\" For once, a last minute impulse buy has turned out to be an absolute gem.",
            "So disappointed! This is such a gorgeous top I was really looking forward to receiving it. I am a standard size 10 34B and when I put it on it looked great until I turned sidewards and could see that it really didn't fit well at the back. It seemed to gape outwards and gave me a peculiar shape. Unfortunately I had to send it back. I could order a smaller size but I have a feeling the armholes may be too small."
